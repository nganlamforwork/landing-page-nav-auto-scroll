# landing-page-nav-auto-scroll
This is the mini test about landing page dom in my team. 

Task 1: Creating the navigation bar that if you click one section, the page will auto scroll to that section. 
Task 2: Creating the scroll top button.

Require: The styles and the smooth scroll.

The HTML and CSS are created. 
I just have to create the nav bar, the scroll top button and add events.
